The State pattern suggests that you create new classes for all possible states of an object and extract all state-specific behaviors into these classes.

This structure may look similar to the Strategy pattern, but thereâ€™s one key difference. In the State pattern, the particular states may be aware of each other and initiate transitions from one state to another, whereas strategies almost never know about each other.
